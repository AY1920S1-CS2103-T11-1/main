* This is an Incident Management System (IMS), a desktop application tailored for emergency call operators.
* Using this app, call operators will record essential information on the incident, and dispatch nearest available vehicles to site at high efficiency.
* The streamlined workflow of the IMS is designed to enable call operators to dispatch vehicles and prepare reports without wasting any precious time.
* IMS is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The roles of an emergency response operator is not only to pick up these calls, but also:

* 1. dispatch vehicles accordingly
* 2. capture incident details in a report

The Incident Management System is a more convenient and less error prone way for the users to complete their jobs.
It allows users to:

* 1. Create and store incidents/reports
* 2. Automised filling of certain fields e.g. Date, time to reduce human error
* 3. Retrieve the report at a later date for reference
* 4. Modify/Update the report

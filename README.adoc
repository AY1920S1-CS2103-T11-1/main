Emergency numbers such as 999 and 995 are just 3 numbers for us to remember in times of need, however, do you ever wonder what is the work that goes behind each of those calls?
The roles of an emergency response operator is not only to pick up these calls, but also:

* 1. dispatch vehicles accordingly
* 2. capture incident details in a report

The Incident Management System is a more convenient and less error prone way for the users to complete their jobs.
It allows users to:

* 1. Create and store incidents/reports
* 2. Automised filling of certain fields e.g. Date, time to reduce human error
* 3. Retrieve the report at a later date for reference
* 4. Modify/Update the report

== Introduction

The Incident Management System (IMS) is a desktop app made for emergency call operators for coordinating emergency vehicle dispatch and incident report generation. IMS is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The streamlined workflow of the IMS is designed to enable call operators to dispatch vehicles and prepare reports without wasting any precious time. That's because, in an emergency, every second counts.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ims.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Incident Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
(TODO)
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
Format: `help`

// tag::access[]

// end::access[]

// tag::account[]
=== Adding a user: `add`

Adds an account to the IMS as a registered user +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A account can have any number of tags (including 0). Only logged-in admins can add tags.

Examples:

* `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com u/oc1 p/1234567 t/Team-1-OC`

=== Updating an account : `update`

Updates an existing account in the incident Manager or the own account of the user logged in if the index is left empty. +
Format: `update [INDEX] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[NOTE]
Only admins can update other user accounts. Non-admins cannot specify an index when executing the update command.

****
* If an index is not provided, update executes on the account of the user logged in.
* If an index is provided, updates the account at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed account list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When updating tags, the existing tags of the account will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* Only admins can access and edit tags. Admins cannot remove their own admin tag.
* You can remove all the account's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `update p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
updates the phone number and email address of the logged in account to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `update 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
updates the name of the 2nd account to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

=== Listing accounts : `list-p`

Shows a list of all accounts registered in the incident Manager or those whose tags match any of the keywords if a keyword is specified. +
Format: `list-p [KEYWORD] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `admin` will match `Admin`
* Only the account tags are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `ad` will not match `admin`
* accounts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `admin team-1` will return all accounts with the `admin` tag and those with the `team-1` tag.
****

=== Locating accounts by name or username: `find-p`

Finds accounts whose name or username contains any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find-p KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name and username is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Accounts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find-p John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find-p Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any account having names or usernames `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

=== Deleting an account : `delete`

Deletes the specified account from the incident Manager. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the account at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed account list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

[NOTE]
Only admins can access the delete command.

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd account in the incident Manager.
* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st account in the results of the `find` command.

// end::account[]

// tag::incident[]

=== Create New Incident: `new`

==== Assumptions
* User has logged in

==== Description
* Unique ID automatically generated for report.
* Takes in district number of accident site and dispatches vehicle near to it.
* Once operator picks up the call, they will key in the district number of accident site to dispatch vehicles.

==== Usage

Format: `new l/DISTRICT_NUM auto/[y/n]`

For multi-step:

* Prompts for default vehicle dispatchment.
** `y`- an available vehicle in the given district is automatically dispatched and attached to the incident.
** `n`- an indexed list of available vehicles in the given district is shown.

=== Filling a draft incident report: `fill`
Fills a draft incident report if relevant parameters are specified, otherwise lists all draft reports ready for filling.

This command works in two modes:

*1. No parameter mode* +
Format: `fill` +
Lists all draft incident reports ready to be filled.

* This command lists both incomplete and complete drafts.
** If no drafts exist, a relevant message is displayed in the GUI result panel while the GUI incident panel view remains unchanged.
* Example usage:

image::fillCommandNoParamsBeforeScreenshot.png[FillExample1]
.Fig X. Incident panel GUI shows all incidents before executing `fill` in no-parameter mode.

* Expected outcome:

image::fillCommandNoParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. Incident panel GUI shows all draft incidents after executing `fill` in no-parameter mode.

*2. Parameter mode* +
Format: `fill [INDEX] [c/CALLER_NUMBER] [d/DESCRIPTION]` +
Fills the draft incident report corresponding to the specified index with the phone number of the caller who reported the incident and the description of the incident.

* Index must be assigned *with reference to the currently shown list of incidents* on the GUI incident panel.
* Both incomplete and complete drafts can be filled.
** Fields of complete drafts will be overwritten.
** Executing this command changes incident `status` to `COMPLETE_DRAFT`.
* Both `CALLER_NUMBER` and `DESCRIPTION` fields must be specified while executing this command.
* The newly filled draft will now appear at the top of the list of incidents in the GUI incident panel view.
* Example usage:

image::fillCommandWithParamsBeforeScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. After using `fill` in no parameter mode, this screenshot shows how to fill the 2nd incident in the displayed list.

* Expected outcome:

image::fillCommandWithParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. After using `fill` in parameter mode, this screenshot shows that the description of the specified incident has been updated while the caller number has been overwritten with the new value. The status of the draft has changed from `INCOMPLETE_DRAFT` to `COMPLETE_DRAFT`.

Using `fill` in both modes one after the other thus enables convenient listing and filling of target incident reports.

=== Submitting a completed draft report: `submit`
Submits a completed draft incident report if relevant parameters are specified, otherwise lists all completed drafts ready for submission.

Similar to `fill`, this command also works in two modes:

*1. No parameter mode* +
Format: `submit` +
Lists all completed draft incident reports ready for submission.

* This command only lists complete drafts.
** If no complete drafts exist, a relevant message is displayed in the GUI result panel while the GUI incident panel view remains unchanged.
* Expected outcome of `submit`:

image::submitCommandNoParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. Executing `submit` in no parameter mode lists all completed drafts ready for submission.

*2. Parameter mode* +
Format: `submit [INDEX]` +
Submits the completed draft incident report corresponding to the specified index.

* Index must be assigned *with reference to the currently shown list of incidents* on the GUI incident panel.
* Only complete drafts can be submitted.
** Executing this command changes incident `status` to `SUBMITTED_REPORT`.
* The newly submitted draft will now appear at the top of the list of incidents in the GUI incident panel view.
* Expected outcome of `submit 2`:

image::submitCommandWithParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. The incident filled using the `fill` command above has been submitted. The newly submitted incident is listed at the top and its status changes from `COMPLETE_DRAFT` to `SUBMITTED_REPORT`.

Using `submit` in both modes right after using `fill` thus enables convenient submitting of newly filled complete incident report drafts.
// end::incident[]

// tag::common[]
//=== Clearing all entries : `clear`
//
//Clears all entries from the incident Manager. +
//Format: `clear`

=== Listing all incidents: `list-i`
Shows a list of all incidents in the Incident Manager +
Format: `list-i`

****
* The listing returns all incidents, inclusive of all drafts and submitted incident reports
* All keywords and parameters used are ignored
****

Example usage and expected outcome:

image::listIncidentsCommand.png[]

=== Locating an incident report using incident ID, operator name or description keyword: `find-i`
Finds incidents containing the relevant specified parameters.
Possible Parameters: `id`/`op`/`desc`

*Different Parameters*

**By Operator Name** +
Format: `find-i op/KEYWORD` +
Lists all incidents whereby the operator name contains the given keyword

* Example usage and expected outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithOperatorParameter.png[]


**By Description** +
Format: `find-i desc/KEYWORD` +
Lists all incidents whereby the incident description contains the given keyword

* Example usage and expected outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithDescriptionParameter.png[]

**By ID**
Format: `find-i id/KEYWORD` +
Lists all incidents whereby the incident ID is an exact match with the given keyword

* Requires an exact ID match
* Example of Failed Usage:
** The ID does not match the given keyword exactly
* Example of Successful Usage:
** ID matches the given keyword exactly

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `dave` will match `Dave`
* Only the specified parameter is searched, and only one parameter can be searched each time
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Fir` will not match `Fire`
****

Examples:

* `find-i id/0920160001` +
Returns Incident #0920160001
* `find-i op/Dave` +
Returns any incidents whereby the operator's name contains 'Dave'
* `find-i desc/fire` +
Returns any incidents whereby the description contains 'fire'

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

Incident Manager data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.
// end::common[]

// tag::incidentversionhistory[]
=== Track incident history `[coming in v2.0]`
Allows user to track any changes made to an incident report throughout its lifecycle in the incident management system. +
Format: `track [INDEX]` +
Function: Outputs a list of timestamps and a brief summary of changes made to the specified incident report.

This feature will allow the user to improve accountability in filing incident reports. As the IMS handles incident data which is very sensitive in nature, it will be crucial for users to know when exactly were what changes made to a given incident report.

// end::incidentversionhistory[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Decrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

Decrypts the incident manager data file. +
Format: `decrypt PASSWORD`

Data files will be encrypted by default. Users can decrypt the file with the command above.

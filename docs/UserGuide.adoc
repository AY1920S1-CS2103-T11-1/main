== Introduction

The Incident Management System (IMS) is a desktop app made for emergency call operators for coordinating emergency vehicle dispatch and incident report generation. IMS is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The streamlined workflow of the IMS is designed to enable call operators to dispatch vehicles and prepare reports without wasting any precious time. That's because, in an emergency, every second counts.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ims.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Incident Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  You will first need to `register` an account, or `login` with one of the pre-made accounts.
.  Logging in with an account that has the `Admin` tag gives you admin access to the system.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
(TODO)
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Some commands have admin restrictions. Admins accounts are identified by the `Admin` tag.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
Format: `help`

// tag::access[]
=== Logging in: `login`

image::account.png[]

// end::access[]

// tag::account[]
=== Registering an account: `register`

Registers an account into the Incident Management System +
Format: `register n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A account can have any number of tags (including 0). Only logged-in admins can add tags.

****
* Usernames must be at least 3 characters in length.
* Usernames can only consist of alphanumeric characters and the following special characters, excluding the parentheses, (.-)
* Usernames cannot begin or end with a non alphanumeric character.
* Usernames and Passwords cannot be blank or contain a whitespace.
* Passwords must be at least 6 characters in length.
* Passwords can only contain alphanumeric characters and/or these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (!#$%&'*+/=?`{|}~^.-)
****

Examples:

* `register n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com u/op1`
* `register n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com u/oc1 p/1234567 t/Team-1-OC`

=== Updating an account : `update`

Updates an existing account in the incident Manager or the own account of the user logged in if the index is left empty. +
Format: `update [INDEX] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[NOTE]
Only admins can update other user accounts. Non-admins cannot specify an index when executing the update command.

****
* If an index is not provided, update executes on the account of the user logged in.
* If an index is provided, updates the account at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed account list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When updating tags, the existing tags of the account will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* Only admins can access and edit tags. Admins cannot remove their own admin tag.
* You can remove all the account's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `update p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
updates the phone number and email address of the logged in account to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `update 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
updates the name of the 2nd account to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

=== Listing accounts : `list-a`

Shows a list of all accounts registered in the incident Manager or those whose tags match any of the keywords if a keyword is specified. +
Format: `list-a [KEYWORD] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `admin` will match `Admin`
* Only the account tags are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `ad` will not match `admin`
* Accounts matching all keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
****

Examples:

* `list-a` +
Displays the entire list of accounts
* `list-a team-1 admin` +
Returns a list of all accounts that have both the `admin` and `team-1` tag

=== Locating accounts by name or username: `find-a`

Finds accounts whose name or username contains any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find-a KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name and username is searched.
* Only full words will be matched for Names e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Partial words will be matched for Usernames e.g. `Agent` will match `Agent01`
* Accounts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find-a John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find-a Betsy agent` +
Returns any account having names or usernames `Betsy` or `agent`

=== Deleting an account : `delete-a`

Deletes the specified account from the incident Manager. +
Format: `delete-a INDEX`

****
* Deletes the account at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed account list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

[NOTE]
Only admins can access the delete command. You cannot delete your own account.

Examples:

* `list-a` +
`delete-a 2` +
Deletes the 2nd account in the incident Manager.
* `find-a Agent01` +
`delete-a 1` +
Deletes the 1st account in the results of the `find` command.

// end::account[]

// tag::incident[]

=== Create New Incident: `new`

This command works in two ways:

*1. auto/y* +
Format: `new l/DISTRICT_NUM auto/y`

* An available vehicle in the given district will be automatically dispatched to the incident site.
* The vehicle pane will show all available vehicles in the district.
** If no vehicle is available, the vehicle pane will be blank, and a relevant message is displayed.

[IMPORTANT]
Valid district numbers are from 1 to 28!

* Example usage:

image::newCommandAutoYBeforeSS.png[]

* Expected outcome: In this case, there is no vehicle available in district 1.

image::newCommandAutoYAfterSS.png[]

*2. auto/n* +
Format: `new l/DISTRICT_NUM auto/n`

* A list of available vehicles in the given district will be shown.
* A message will also appear to prompt user to also include the index of the chosen vehicle.
** If no vehicle is available, the vehicle pane will be blank, and a relevant message is displayed.

* Example usage:

image::newCommandAutoNBeforeSS.png[]

image::newCommandAutoNPromptSS.png[]

image::newCommandAutoNAfterPromptSS.png[]

image::newCommandAutoNAfterSS.png[

[IMPORTANT]
If multiple flags of the same prefix is provided by user, the command will take the last valid parameter of each prefix. +
For example `new l/1 l/2 l/3 auto/y auto/n` is equivalent to `new l/3 auto/n`. +
Rationale: user need not waste time backspacing if an input was keyed in wrongly.

=== Filling a draft incident report: `fill`
Fills a draft incident report if relevant parameters are specified, otherwise lists all draft reports ready for filling.

This command works in two modes:

*1. No parameter mode* +
Format: `fill` +
Lists all draft incident reports ready to be filled.

* This command lists both incomplete and complete drafts.
** If no drafts exist, a relevant message is displayed in the GUI result panel while the GUI incident panel view remains unchanged.
* Example usage:

image::fillCommandNoParamsBeforeScreenshot.png[FillExample1]
.Fig X. Incident panel GUI shows all incidents before executing `fill` in no-parameter mode.

* Expected outcome:

image::fillCommandNoParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. Incident panel GUI shows all draft incidents after executing `fill` in no-parameter mode.

*2. Parameter mode* +
Format: `fill [INDEX] [c/CALLER_NUMBER] [d/DESCRIPTION]` +
Fills the draft incident report corresponding to the specified index with the phone number of the caller who reported the incident and the description of the incident.

* Index must be assigned *with reference to the currently shown list of incidents* on the GUI incident panel.
* Both incomplete and complete drafts can be filled.
** Fields of complete drafts will be overwritten.
** Executing this command changes incident `status` to `COMPLETE_DRAFT`.
* Both `CALLER_NUMBER` and `DESCRIPTION` fields must be specified while executing this command.
* The newly filled draft will now appear at the top of the list of incidents in the GUI incident panel view.
* Example usage:

image::fillCommandWithParamsBeforeScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. After using `fill` in no parameter mode, this screenshot shows how to fill the 2nd incident in the displayed list.

* Expected outcome:

image::fillCommandWithParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. After using `fill` in parameter mode, this screenshot shows that the description of the specified incident has been updated while the caller number has been overwritten with the new value. The status of the draft has changed from `INCOMPLETE_DRAFT` to `COMPLETE_DRAFT`.

Using `fill` in both modes one after the other thus enables convenient listing and filling of target incident reports.

=== Submitting a completed draft report: `submit`
Submits a completed draft incident report if relevant parameters are specified, otherwise lists all completed drafts ready for submission.

Similar to `fill`, this command also works in two modes:

*1. No parameter mode* +
Format: `submit` +
Lists all completed draft incident reports ready for submission.

* This command only lists complete drafts.
** If no complete drafts exist, a relevant message is displayed in the GUI result panel while the GUI incident panel view remains unchanged.
* Expected outcome of `submit`:

image::submitCommandNoParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. Executing `submit` in no parameter mode lists all completed drafts ready for submission.

*2. Parameter mode* +
Format: `submit [INDEX]` +
Submits the completed draft incident report corresponding to the specified index.

* Index must be assigned *with reference to the currently shown list of incidents* on the GUI incident panel.
* Only complete drafts can be submitted.
** Executing this command changes incident `status` to `SUBMITTED_REPORT`.
* The newly submitted draft will now appear at the top of the list of incidents in the GUI incident panel view.
* Expected outcome of `submit 2`:

image::submitCommandWithParamsAfterScreenshot.png[]
.Fig X. The incident filled using the `fill` command above has been submitted. The newly submitted incident is listed at the top and its status changes from `COMPLETE_DRAFT` to `SUBMITTED_REPORT`.

Using `submit` in both modes right after using `fill` thus enables convenient submitting of newly filled complete incident report drafts.
// end::incident[]

// tag::common[]
//=== Clearing all entries : `clear`
//
//Clears all entries from the incident Manager. +
//Format: `clear`

=== Listing all incidents: `list-i`
Shows a list of all incidents in the Incident Manager +
Format: `list-i`

****
* The listing returns all incidents, inclusive of all drafts and submitted incident reports
* All keywords and parameters used are ignored
****

Example usage and expected outcome:

image::listIncidentsCommand.png[]

=== Locating an incident report using incident ID, operator name or description keyword: `find-i`
Finds incidents containing the relevant specified parameters.
Possible Parameters: `id`/`op`/`desc`

*Different Parameters*

**By Operator Name** +
Format: `find-i op/KEYWORD` +
Lists all incidents whereby the operator name contains the given keyword

* Example of Successful Usage and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithOperatorParameter.png[]

* Example of Failed Usage and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithOperatorParameterFailed.png[]

**By Description** +
Format: `find-i desc/KEYWORD` +
Lists all incidents whereby the incident description contains the given keyword

* Example of Successful Usage and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithDescriptionParameter.png[]

* Example of Failed Usage and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithDescriptionParameterFailed.png[]

**By ID**
Format: `find-i id/KEYWORD` +
Lists all incidents whereby the incident ID is an exact match with the given keyword

* Example of Successful Usage and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithIdParameter.png[]

* Example of Failed Usage and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithIdParameterFailed.png[]

* Requires an exact ID match
* Example of Failed Usage:
** The ID does not match the given keyword exactly
* Example of Successful Usage:
** ID matches the given keyword exactly

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `dave` will match `Dave`
* Only the specified parameter is searched, and only one parameter can be searched each time
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Fir` will not match `Fire`
****

Examples:

* `find-i id/0920160001` +
Returns Incident #0920160001
* `find-i op/Dave` +
Returns any incidents whereby the operator's name contains 'Dave'
* `find-i desc/fire` +
Returns any incidents whereby the description contains 'fire'

=== Editing an Incident: `edit-i`

Edits an existing incident in the Incident Manager as identified by the index in the display.
Format: `edit-i [INDEX] [l/DISTRICT] [C/CALLER NUMBER] [d/DESCRIPTION]`

** If an index is not provided, system will prompt for index. Does not make any edits.

** Number of fields provided for update is optional and can vary.
[NOTE]
If no fields are provided, incident will remain unchanged.

** Existing values will be updated to input values provided.
** Edits that result in duplicate incidents are not allowed

[NOTE]
Incidents with all the same fields (`DateTime`, `District`, `IncidentId`, `Caller Number`) are considered duplicates.

Example of input:

** `edit-i 1 l/2 d/This is an incident description.`
*** result: only district and description is changed.

[NOTE]
All fields must be provided in order to make a valid addition to the Incident Management System. If any of the fields are missing,
vehicle will not be added.

** Vehicles that have the same vehicle number and vehicle type are considered to duplicate vehicles

** Duplicate vehicles cannot be added into the Incident Management System.

Examples:

** `add-v l/2 vn/12345 vt/Ambulance a/available`
*** result: `New vehicle added: Ambulance Vehicle Number: 12345 District: 2 Availability: AVAILABLE`

** `add-v l/12 vn/23456 vt/Patrol Car a/busy`

Allows user to track any changes made to an incident report throughout its lifecycle in the incident management system. +
Format: `track [INDEX]` +
Function: Outputs a list of timestamps and a brief summary of changes made to the specified incident report.

This feature will allow the user to improve accountability in filing incident reports. As the IMS handles incident data which is very sensitive in nature, it will be crucial for users to know when exactly were what changes made to a given incident report.

// end::incidentversionhistory[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Decrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

Decrypts the incident manager data file. +
Format: `decrypt PASSWORD`

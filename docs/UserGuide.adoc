== Introduction

The Incident Management System (IMS) is a desktop app made for emergency call operators for coordinating emergency vehicle dispatch and incident report generation. IMS is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The streamlined workflow of the IMS is designed to enable call operators to dispatch vehicles and prepare reports without wasting any precious time. That's because, in an emergency, every second counts.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ims.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
(TODO)
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Once operator picks up the call, they will key in the postal code of accident site to dispatch vehicles.

==== Usage

Format: `new POSTAL_CODE`

For multi-step:

* Prompts for default vehicle dispatchment.
** `y`- the available vehicle nearest to given postal code is dispatched.
** `n`- an indexed list of available vehicles near the given postal code is given in descending order of proximity.

=== Filling a new report: `fill`

==== Description
* Generates a new report and prompts operator to enter data into report fields.
* Unique ID automatically generated for report.
* Date/time, operator name, and operator name are auto-filled.

==== Usage

Format: `fill [n/CALLER_NAME d/INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION]`

For multi-step:

* Prompts for name of caller. Operator types it and presses `enter`.

=== Submit a report: `submit`

==== Description

* Submits a just-filled report if one is available, else shows a list of unsubmitted draft reports.

==== Usage
Format: `submit`

For new report:

* `y` or `submit`- to submit the report immediately.
* Submission has to be done before user can edit again.
* `n`- to save entry as draft.

For other reports:

* If the the `submit` command is issued at any other time, the operator will be shown an indexed list of unsubmitted draft reports.
* The IMS will then prompt thehe operator to enter the index number of the report they wish to submit. The operator types that number and presses `enter` to submit the chosen report.
* The submission of a report will trigger three other operations:
1. an unique ID will be generated to tag the report
2. an automated email will be sent to the operator's supervisor
3. the report will be saved in the database

== PROJECT: IncidentManager

'''

== Overview

The Incident Management System is a desktop application used for managing incidents. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

** What it does: allows the user to edit the details of the vehicles and incidents
** Justification: This feature allows post entry management of the elements in the Incident Manager.
** Highlights: A variable number of fields can be used together with the command so that the user only needs to input fields that are necessary.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented other CRUD commands for Vehicle object such as *add* and *delete* as well as Incident model.
